      <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>From what I read,Progressive Enhancement
      is valuing web content over presentation in a website.
      It involves pulling the content of a website away
      from the presentation.It allows you to enhance the
      content before putting it back with the presentation.
      It is a great way to improve the experience of the
      website. It is important in modern web developement
      because it provides better content and functionality
      to many users.<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/">

     <h3>Dragon Project Revision and Evaluation</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>Revision Paragraph:When I started this project, I wanted to get as little work work done to make the website look decent. From the critism from my teacher,Thomas Wallace,he said I needed to make my links easier to see, adjust the logo image,set a max width, and change the contrast of words with certain background colors. I've decided to attempt these changes and it looks better now besids the logo.I also asked my roommate to look at my website. They said I should have changed the colors of a few things and I decided to listen to them and did what they asked. I believe it looks better with their suggestions.</li>
      <li>Evaluation Paragraph:This project helped me decide if I wanted to go further into web developement and I decided not to.The experience I got from this class has given me enough information to make a basic website and I hope I will be able to use that in the future. I believe I retained the information I was taught well. If I had to start over,what I would do differently would be to do more reasearch on the content we learned.</li>
